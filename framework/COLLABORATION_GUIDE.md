# üë• CLARITY Framework Collaboration Guide

## Roles, Responsibilities and Team Coordination

---

## üéØ **Framework Overview for Teams**

The **CLARITY Framework** is designed for collaborative product specification creation that enables **successful delegation** to development teams or AI systems. This guide defines how different roles collaborate to create complete, coherent specifications.

### **Core Collaboration Principles**

```yaml
successful_collaboration:
  - Clear ownership per document with cross-functional input
  - Iterative validation between roles at each phase
  - Consistent terminology and cross-references
  - Documentation that serves development, not just process

delegation_success:
  - Each role contributes their domain expertise
  - All roles validate final specifications
  - Clear handoff criteria and success metrics
  - Development team can start without additional questions
```
