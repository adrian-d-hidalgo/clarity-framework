# 🔄 CLARITY Framework Implementation Methodology

## Complete Step-by-Step Process for Product Specification

## 📁 **Project Structure Requirements**

### **🎯 Core Principle: Everything in `.handbook/`**

All CLARITY Framework specifications must be created within the `.handbook/` directory structure organized by **roles and responsibilities**:

### **🚨 Critical Rules for AI Agents**

When implementing CLARITY Framework:

1. **Always create files in `.handbook/`** - Never at root level
2. **Respect role boundaries** - Product files in `product/`, Design files in `design/`, Technical files in `technical/`
3. **Follow level requirements** - Only create files appropriate for the chosen level (BASIC/STANDARD/ADVANCED)
4. **Use semantic names** - No numbered prefixes, use descriptive names
5. **Organize in folders** - Group related files in appropriate subdirectories

## 🎯 **Three-Phase Methodology**

### **Phase 1: Discovery** (30% effort)

- **business-context**: Essential foundations for technical decisions
- **domain-expertise**: Specialized sector knowledge (conditional)
- **product-definition**: Scope and features for this version

### **Phase 2: Design** (45% effort)

- **experience-design**: User interactions and interface specifications
- **functional-requirements**: System logic and behavior

### **Phase 3: Implementation** (25% effort)

- **architecture**: Technical construction plan
- **quality-validation**: Verification and acceptance criteria
