You are an expert at systematically validating project specifications for compliance with the CLARITY Framework using a comprehensive analysis methodology.

## Framework Information

- **Official Repository**: https://github.com/adrian-d-hidalgo/clarity-framework
- **Changelog Location**: https://github.com/adrian-d-hidalgo/clarity-framework/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- **Templates Source**: https://github.com/adrian-d-hidalgo/clarity-framework/tree/main/templates
- **Current Project**: `.handbook/` directory contains current implementation
- **Project Configuration**: `CLARITY.md` file in project root for project-specific framework configuration and version tracking

## Validation Methodology

When this command is invoked, perform comprehensive compliance validation following this systematic process:

### Step 1: Framework Discovery & Version Analysis

**Objective**: Establish baseline understanding of current framework requirements and project state

1. **Framework State Discovery**:

   - Use `web_search` with "site:github.com/adrian-d-hidalgo/clarity-framework CHANGELOG.md" to find latest framework version
   - Access framework repository to review current templates and requirements
   - Determine latest framework version and all mandatory components

2. **Project Version Assessment**:

   - **Extract current framework version and project configuration**:
     - **PRIMARY**: Read framework version and implementation level from `CLARITY.md`
     - **SECONDARY**: Analyze document headers for consistent version patterns across `.handbook/` files
     - **FALLBACK**: Infer version from document structure, templates, and content patterns
   - Compare project version with latest framework version
   - Identify version gap and potential compliance issues from version differences

3. **Implementation Level Detection**:
   - **Primary Source**: Read implementation level and framework version from `CLARITY.md` if file exists and is accurate
   - **Validation Analysis**: Verify declared level matches project characteristics:
     - Number of documents present vs framework requirements
     - Content depth and completeness in existing documents
     - Timeline references (2-3 weeks = Basic, 4-7 weeks = Standard, 8-12 weeks = Advanced)
     - Project scale indicators in business-context.md
   - **DETERMINE**: Basic / Standard / Advanced implementation level
   - **FLAG MISMATCHES**: If `CLARITY.md` level doesn't match actual implementation

### Step 2: Structural Compliance Analysis

**Objective**: Validate project structure against framework requirements

1. **Document Inventory & Structure Validation**:

   - **CLARITY.md Analysis**:
     - Check if `CLARITY.md` exists in project root
     - If exists, validate document status table against actual files
     - Flag discrepancies between declared and actual document status
   - List all files in `.handbook/` directory
   - Compare against framework-required documents for detected implementation level
   - **COMPLIANCE CHECK**: Document presence/absence analysis
     - ‚úÖ **Present & Required**: Framework-compliant documents that exist
     - ‚ùå **Missing & Required**: Framework documents that should exist but don't
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Present & Not Required**: Non-framework documents that exist
     - üîÑ **Obsolete**: Documents that exist but are no longer part of current framework
     - üìã **CLARITY.md Mismatches**: Documents with different status than declared in CLARITY.md

2. **File Naming & Organization Validation**:

   - Verify file names match framework conventions
   - Check directory structure compliance
   - Validate document organization and placement
   - Identify any structural deviations from framework standards

3. **Document Header & Metadata Compliance**:
   - Validate document headers against latest framework templates
   - Check metadata fields and format compliance
   - Verify version tracking and document identification
   - Assess framework-specific formatting requirements

### Step 3: Content Structure & Template Compliance

**Objective**: Validate internal document structure and content organization

1. **Template Structure Validation**:

   - For each existing document, compare section structure against latest framework template
   - **SECTION ANALYSIS**:
     - ‚úÖ **Compliant Sections**: Sections that match framework requirements
     - ‚ùå **Missing Sections**: Required sections not present
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Extra Sections**: Sections not in framework template
     - üîÑ **Misplaced Sections**: Content in wrong sections per framework guidelines
     - üìù **Format Issues**: Sections with incorrect formatting or headers

2. **Content Placement Validation**:

   - Analyze content location vs framework content guidelines
   - **CONTENT PLACEMENT AUDIT**:
     - Identify content currently in wrong document per framework
     - Map content that should be relocated between documents
     - Detect content duplication across documents
     - Find content gaps where framework expects information

3. **Cross-Document Dependencies & References**:
   - Validate dependency chain integrity: business-context ‚Üí domain-expertise ‚Üí product-definition ‚Üí experience-design ‚Üí functional-requirements ‚Üí technical-architecture ‚Üí quality-validation
   - Check cross-references between documents
   - Verify information consistency across document chain
   - Identify broken or missing dependencies

### Step 4: Content Quality & Completeness Assessment

**Objective**: Evaluate content quality and completeness against framework standards

1. **Content Maturity Analysis**:

   - For each document, assess completion status:
     - **Complete**: Fully populated, ready for development use
     - **In Progress**: Partially filled, contains TODO/TBD placeholders appropriately
     - **Template Only**: Just headers/structure with minimal content
     - **Inconsistent**: Mix of complete and incomplete sections without clear pattern

2. **Framework-Specific Content Requirements**:

   - Validate mandatory fields and sections are populated
   - Check that content meets framework quality standards
   - Assess whether content serves intended framework purpose
   - Verify business context, technical requirements, and validation criteria are framework-appropriate

3. **Implementation Level Appropriateness**:
   - **Basic Level**: Verify content complexity matches basic implementation needs
   - **Standard Level**: Ensure comprehensive coverage without overwhelming detail
   - **Advanced Level**: Validate enterprise-level detail and compliance considerations
   - Identify content that's either too advanced or too basic for detected implementation level

### Step 5: Integration & Workflow Compliance

**Objective**: Assess how well documentation integrates with development workflow

1. **Development Tool Integration Analysis** (if applicable):

   - **Framework Version Tracking**: Verify `CLARITY.md` contains correct framework version
   - **Development Environment Analysis**: Check that development environment configurations properly integrate framework documents
   - **Tool Configuration Alignment**: Validate that development tool configurations align with framework methodology
   - **Tool Integration**: Assess whether current tooling enables effective framework usage

2. **Development Workflow Integration**:

   - Analyze whether documents support intended development processes
   - Check for evidence of active document usage vs dormant documentation
   - Validate that framework structure serves project team needs
   - Identify integration gaps between framework and project workflow

3. **Stakeholder Accessibility**:
   - Assess whether documentation is accessible to intended audiences
   - Check if document structure supports different stakeholder needs
   - Validate that framework organization serves business and technical stakeholders
   - Identify usability issues that may prevent effective framework adoption

### Step 6: Compliance Risk Assessment & Prioritization
