## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document defines **exactly how to build the system** by specifying technical architecture, technology choices, infrastructure requirements, and implementation patterns. It translates functional specifications into a concrete construction plan that developers can follow directly.

> **Principle:** Every architectural decision must be justified and implementable, with clear patterns for development teams to follow.

## üîó **INTEGRATION PATTERNS & GUIDANCE** _(CORE - Required)_

### **API Integration Patterns**

**RESTful API Integration:**

- **Pattern:** Request-Response with proper HTTP methods
- **Authentication:** Bearer token (JWT) or API key
- **Error Handling:** Standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs
- **Timeout Strategy:** 30 seconds for external APIs, 10 seconds for internal services
- **Retry Logic:** Maximum 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)

**Event-Driven Integration:**

- **Pattern:** Publish-Subscribe or Event Streaming
- **Message Format:** JSON with schema validation
- **Delivery Guarantee:** At-least-once delivery with idempotency
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Handle failed message processing
- **Event Ordering:** Ensure proper event sequencing for related events

### **Database Integration Patterns**

**Primary Database Access:**

- **Pattern:** Repository pattern with ORM
- **Connection Pooling:** 10-20 connections per application instance
- **Query Optimization:** Use indexes and query analysis
- **Transaction Management:** ACID compliance for critical operations
- **Migration Strategy:** Versioned database migrations with rollback capability

**Caching Strategy:**

- **L1 Cache:** Application-level caching (in-memory)
- **L2 Cache:** Distributed caching (Redis/Memcached)
- **Cache Invalidation:** Time-based TTL + event-based invalidation
- **Cache-aside Pattern:** Application manages cache population

### **Third-Party Service Integration**

**Payment Gateway Integration:**

- **Pattern:** Adapter pattern for multiple payment providers
- **Security:** PCI DSS compliance, tokenization of payment data
- **Fallback Strategy:** Primary and backup payment processors
- **Webhook Handling:** Secure webhook validation and processing
- **Testing:** Sandbox environment for development and testing

**Email Service Integration:**

- **Pattern:** Template-based email composition
- **Delivery:** Transactional and marketing email separation
- **Tracking:** Open rates, click rates, bounce handling
- **Fallback:** Multiple email service providers for reliability

**File Storage Integration:**

- **Pattern:** Cloud storage with CDN distribution
- **Security:** Signed URLs for secure access
- **Versioning:** File versioning for important documents
- **Backup:** Cross-region replication for critical files

### **Error Handling & Resilience**

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**

- **Implementation:** Fail fast when external services are down
- **Thresholds:** Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- **Recovery:** Half-open state for gradual recovery testing
- **Monitoring:** Alert on circuit breaker state changes

**Bulkhead Pattern:**

- **Implementation:** Isolate different types of operations
- **Resource Isolation:** Separate thread pools for different services
- **Failure Isolation:** Prevent cascading failures across system components

**Timeout & Retry Strategy:**

- **Connection Timeout:** 5 seconds for establishing connections
- **Read Timeout:** 30 seconds for external APIs, 10 seconds for internal
- **Retry Strategy:** Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Maximum Retries:** 3 attempts for transient failures

### **Data Synchronization Patterns**

**Event Sourcing (if applicable):**

- **Pattern:** Store events instead of current state
- **Event Store:** Append-only event log
- **Projections:** Build read models from events
- **Replay Capability:** Reconstruct state from events

**Data Consistency:**

- **Strong Consistency:** For financial and critical data
- **Eventual Consistency:** For non-critical data and caching
- **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins or application-specific logic

### **Monitoring & Observability Integration**

**Distributed Tracing:**

- **Implementation:** Trace requests across all services
- **Correlation IDs:** Track requests through the entire system
- **Performance Monitoring:** Identify bottlenecks in integrations

**Health Checks:**

- **Endpoint:** `/health` for basic service health
- **Deep Health:** `/health/detailed` for dependency status
- **External Dependencies:** Monitor third-party service health
