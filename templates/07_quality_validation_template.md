# ‚úÖ Quality Validation

**Document:** quality-validation  
**Recommended Owner:** QA Lead/Product Manager  
**Security Level:** [Standard/Elevated/Critical]

---

## üìã **Document Dependencies**

**Requires completion of:**

- **product-definition.md**: Feature specifications, success criteria
- **functional-requirements.md**: Acceptance criteria, system requirements
- **technical-architecture.md**: Performance criteria, deployment requirements

**Provides to next documents:**

- This is the final validation document

---

## ‚úÖ **Quality Gates**

**Before considering project ready for development, ensure:**

- [ ] Complete test strategy documented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria testable
- [ ] Quality gates clearly defined
- [ ] Testing tools and processes specified
- [ ] Release criteria established

---

## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document defines **exactly how to verify the system works correctly** by specifying testing strategies, acceptance criteria, quality gates, and validation procedures. It ensures the final product meets all requirements and works reliably in production.

> **Principle:** Every requirement must have verifiable, automated tests and clear acceptance criteria that determine success or failure.
