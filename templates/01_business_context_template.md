## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document establishes the **minimum business context** necessary for making correct technical decisions during product development. It focuses exclusively on information that directly affects how the product should be built, not general market analysis.

> **Principle:** Only include business information that influences technical implementation decisions.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Decision Frameworks**

### **Trade-off Decision Matrix**

When business and technical requirements conflict, use this priority framework:

**Performance vs Features:**

- **Choose Performance when:** User experience is critical, high-scale requirements, real-time needs
- **Choose Features when:** MVP validation, competitive pressure, limited technical resources
- **Decision criteria:** User impact > business impact > technical complexity

**Quality vs Speed:**

- **Choose Quality when:** Security critical, regulated industry, long-term product
- **Choose Speed when:** Market window closing, proof of concept, competitive response
- **Decision criteria:** Risk assessment > business timeline > technical debt tolerance

**Cost vs Capability:**

- **Choose Cost when:** Budget constraints, early stage startup, uncertain market
- **Choose Capability when:** Competitive advantage, proven market, scale requirements
- **Decision criteria:** ROI analysis > strategic importance > implementation complexity

### **Conflict Resolution Process**

1. **Identify the conflict:** [Business requirement] vs [Technical constraint]
2. **Apply decision matrix:** Use framework above
3. **Document the decision:** Record rationale for future reference
4. **Set review trigger:** When to revisit this decision
