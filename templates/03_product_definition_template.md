# üì± Product Definition

**Document:** product-definition  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Security Level:** [Standard/Elevated/Critical]

---

## üìã **Document Dependencies**

**Requires completion of:**

- **business-context.md**: User types, business model, success metrics, security level
- **domain-expertise.md**: Domain-specific user characteristics, compliance requirements, industry standards

**Provides to next documents:**

- **experience-design.md**: User personas, feature specifications, content structure
- **functional-requirements.md**: Feature acceptance criteria, data models, business rules

---

## ‚úÖ **Quality Gates**

**Before proceeding to next documents, ensure:**

- [ ] Feature scope clearly defined and bounded
- [ ] User personas complete with domain-informed characteristics
- [ ] Success metrics identified and measurable
- [ ] Technical feasibility validated

---

## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document defines **exactly what to build** for this version of the product. It translates business priorities into specific features, user personas, and scope boundaries that guide all subsequent design and development decisions.

> **Principle:** Every element must be specific enough to prevent scope creep and clear enough to guide development decisions.
