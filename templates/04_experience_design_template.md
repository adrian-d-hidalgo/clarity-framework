## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document specifies **how the product should function and look** from the user's perspective. It translates product features into specific user interactions, interface designs, and experience flows that developers can implement directly.

> **Principle:** Every interaction and interface element must be specific enough for direct implementation, not just conceptual guidance.

---

## üî¨ **User Research & Validation**

### **Research Methodology**

**Validation of Business Context Assumptions:**

- **User Personas Validation:** Interview 5-8 users per persona to validate assumptions from product-definition
- **Problem Validation:** Confirm the primary problems identified in business-context are real and significant
- **Solution Validation:** Test that proposed features actually solve user problems

**Research Methods:**

1. **User Interviews** (3-5 per persona)

   - **Purpose:** Validate personas, understand mental models, identify pain points
   - **Duration:** 45-60 minutes each
   - **Key Questions:** [e.g., "Walk me through how you currently solve [problem]"]

2. **Task Analysis** (5-8 users)

   - **Purpose:** Understand current workflows and identify improvement opportunities
   - **Method:** Observe users completing relevant tasks with current solutions
   - **Output:** Task flow documentation and pain point identification

3. **Competitive Analysis** (3-5 direct competitors)
   - **Purpose:** Understand interaction patterns users are familiar with
   - **Focus:** UX patterns, not just features
   - **Output:** Pattern library of familiar interactions

### **Validation Criteria**

**Before proceeding with design, confirm:**

- [ ] User personas match real user characteristics (validated through interviews)
- [ ] Primary user problems are confirmed and prioritized by users
- [ ] Users understand and value the proposed solution approach
- [ ] Key user workflows are documented and understood
- [ ] Accessibility needs are identified for target user groups

### **Research Findings Integration**

**User Mental Models:**

- **How users currently think about the problem:** [e.g., "Users think of task management as project-based, not time-based"]
- **Key terminology users prefer:** [e.g., "Users say 'projects' not 'workspaces'"]
- **Workflow patterns users expect:** [e.g., "Users expect to see progress before details"]

**Accessibility Requirements Identified:**

- **Visual Impairments:** [e.g., "15% of target users have some color vision deficiency"]
- **Motor Limitations:** [e.g., "Mobile users often use device one-handed"]
- **Cognitive Considerations:** [e.g., "Users prefer progressive disclosure for complex tasks"]

### **Design Validation Plan**

**Prototype Testing Approach:**

1. **Low-fidelity wireframe testing** (5 users per major flow)
2. **High-fidelity prototype testing** (8-10 users across personas)
3. **Accessibility testing** (2-3 users with accessibility needs)

**Success Metrics for Design:**

- **Task Completion Rate:** >85% for primary tasks
- **Time to Complete:** <[specific time] for key workflows
- **Error Rate:** <10% for critical actions
- **User Satisfaction:** >4.0/5.0 on usability scale
