# ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

**Document:** functional-requirements  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Security Level:** [Standard/Elevated/Critical]

---

## üìã **Document Dependencies**

**Requires completion of:**

- **domain-expertise.md**: Domain-specific requirements, compliance standards
- **product-definition.md**: Feature specifications, business rules
- **experience-design.md**: User interface specifications, interaction patterns

**Provides to next documents:**

- **technical-architecture.md**: System requirements, API specifications
- **quality-validation.md**: Acceptance criteria, testing requirements

---

## ‚úÖ **Quality Gates**

**Before proceeding to next documents, ensure:**

- [ ] All API endpoints specified with contracts
- [ ] Business logic completely documented
- [ ] Data models and relationships defined
- [ ] Security requirements integrated
- [ ] Error handling scenarios covered

---

## üéØ **Document Purpose**

This document defines **exactly how the system should behave** by specifying business logic, data flows, API contracts, and system rules. It translates user experience requirements into technical specifications that developers can implement directly.

> **Principle:** Every specification must be precise enough to code directly, with no ambiguity about system behavior.
