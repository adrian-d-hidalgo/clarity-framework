## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**Common development challenges:**

- 📋 Teams build something different from what was requested
- 💸 Development costs spiral due to misaligned expectations
- 🔄 Multiple iterations required due to incomplete specifications
- ⏰ Projects extend beyond deadlines due to unclear requirements
- 🤖 AI development tools produce unusable results from vague prompts

**CLARITY Framework eliminates these issues through systematic specification.**

## ✨ What is CLARITY Framework?

A **systematic framework** for creating specifications so complete and clear that any team (human or AI) can build exactly what you need, without misunderstandings.

### **Think of it as "architectural blueprints" for software**

- 🏗️ **Architect → Builder**: Blueprint defines exactly what to construct
- 💻 **You → Developers**: CLARITY Framework defines exactly what to program
- 🎯 **Result**: You get exactly what you envisioned, without surprises

## 🚀 How Does It Work?

### **📋 7 Documents = Complete Specification**

You follow a sequence of documents organized by **roles** that, when completed, define **everything** needed to build your product:

| Role          | Document                    | What you define here                      | Example                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **PM**        | **Business Context**        | Market, problem, business constraints     | "Fitness app for women 40+ with no prior experience" |
| **PM**        | **Domain Expertise**        | Industry knowledge and regulations        | "Training principles, safe progression plans"        |
| **PM**        | **Product Definition**      | Features, scope, user personas            | "iOS/Android app with plans, tracking, AI"           |
| **Designer**  | **Experience Design**       | User flows, wireframes, UI specifications | "15 screens, navigation flows, interaction design"   |
| **PM**        | **Functional Requirements** | Business logic and system behavior        | "API endpoints, business rules, algorithms"          |
| **Architect** | **Technical Architecture**  | Technical design and implementation       | "React Native, AWS, PostgreSQL, architecture"        |
| **PM**        | **Quality Validation**      | Testing strategy and acceptance criteria  | "Tests, acceptance criteria, metrics"                |
