## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**Common development challenges:**

- 📋 Teams build something different from what was requested
- 💸 Development costs spiral due to misaligned expectations
- 🔄 Multiple iterations required due to incomplete specifications
- ⏰ Projects extend beyond deadlines due to unclear requirements
- 🤖 AI development tools produce unusable results from vague prompts
- 🔄 Human-AI handoffs fail due to incomplete specifications

**CLARITY Framework eliminates these issues through systematic specification.**

## ✨ What is CLARITY Framework?

A **systematic framework** for human teams to create specifications (with AI assistance) so complete and clear that AI systems can build exactly what you need, with minimal human intervention.

### **Think of it as "architectural blueprints" for software**

- 🏗️ **Architect → Builder**: Blueprint defines exactly what to construct
- 💻 **You → AI Developer**: CLARITY Framework defines exactly what to program
- 🎯 **Result**: AI builds exactly what you envisioned, with minimal human validation
